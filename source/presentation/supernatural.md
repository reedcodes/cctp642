## Religion on television

"Television as a medium thus holds the ability to simultaneously forward hegemonic portrayals of religion(s) and expose viewers to other, less familiar religions." (68)

## Many television series

- ambiguous or absent religion
- religion vs. skepticism
- overly religious themes

## _Supernatural_

- 15 seasons from 2005 through 2020
- fighting monsters, demons, ghosts, evil
- culture, folklore, urban legends, religion

## Research question

"Thus, we aim to discover how the series _Supernatural_ portrays religion in terms of hegemony: which one(s) does it portray as dominant and how does it portray “nonmainstream” religions?" (74)

{% endrevealsection %}

## Good vs. evil

1. Catholicism is portrayed as "good"
1. other religions are not good or even evil

## Non-Catholic faiths

"With no positive characters from these “outside” religions, the lack of help from anyone practicing or familiar with these other forms of faith emphasizes their marginalization." (81)
{% endrevealsection %}



{% revealsection %}

## Catholicism without being "Catholic"

- Latin language and incantations
- crucifixes, holy water, and other weapons
- demons from Hell
{% endrevealsection %}

## Further research

- Do the brothers experience any religious conversion due to their experiences?
- Have fans sought out their own exploration of religion, lore, or myths after learning about them through the series?
